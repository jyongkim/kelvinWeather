# kelvinWeather
Kelvin Weather is the first project from Codecademy's Learn JavaScript Course.

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.
Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website. However there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Kelvin.
With our knowledge of JavaScript, let’s convert Kelvin to Celsius, then to Fahrenheit.
